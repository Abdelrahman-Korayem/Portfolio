Next + TypeScript + Tailwind starter generated from uploaded HTML/CSS/JS.

Path in container: /mnt/data/next-portfolio

How to use:
1. cd portfolio
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

Notes:
- The original CSS was preserved in styles/globals.css after Tailwind directives so the site keeps the original look.
- You can gradually convert the styles to Tailwind utility classes for smaller CSS footprint.
- Images referenced in the original HTML were copied if present under /assets. If not, add them to public/assets/images.
